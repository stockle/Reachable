# Reachable
Last year for LinkedIn Reach I wrote a LaTeX doc to answer the questions thinking I would have to submit a file.

It ended up being three separate text fields.

They only accept the first 400 apps and those go quick.

Lost 5 minutes copy and pasting.

Then my internet froze.

# Never Again

So I wrote a simple Chrome extension to:
  1. draft my essay questions
  2. macro the fields to arbitrary key bindings
  3. paste them in record time
  
## Why?

Some people may not have strong internet connections.

Some people may hate context switching copy/pasting.

Some people may need a leg up due to diabilities.

## How?

  1. `git clone https://github.com/scollet1/Reachable.git`
  2. navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
  3. Click Load Unpacked and select the folder containing this repo
  4. enjoy your extra 5 minutes of not copy/pasting

## What's Next?

Archive the Reach application page and see if I can't run a selenium pass next year.
